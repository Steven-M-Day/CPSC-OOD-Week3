# CPSC-OOD-Week3

I decided to see if I could wrap the loader in a gui. Turns out it works pretty well. I also left
the original code, but commented it out toward the top of the file, incase you wanted to run that instead. 

Run bakerycontrolloader.java file to start program. You will be presented with a gui with three buttons. 
The buttons allow for differing functionality for the user. 
The user can Open the bakery, Close the bakery, or Test the bakery as a whole.  

Components to be controlled are: 

 -- Door lock
 -- Bakery light
 -- Kitchen light
 -- Oven
 -- Vent
